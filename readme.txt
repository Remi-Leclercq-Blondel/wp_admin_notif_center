Keep your dashboard clean by grouping all the wordpress notifications in a notification center.

== Description ==

Tired of having the top of your screen full of notifications coming from all the plugins you've installed?

Here is what you will be able to:
* Display or not the notifications depending on users roles.
* Group all your notifications in a notification center located at the right of your page.
* Use the bouton on the top bar to display / hide this notification center.
* Be informed when a new notification is present (thanks to a badge displayed on your admin bar)
* Select the notification types (information/warning/error) you want to be displayed in the notification center. And the ones you would like to be displayed at the top of your screen

== Installation ==

You can download the package on wordpress.org and install it on your website or directly install it via the plugin installer on your backend.

== Screenshots ==
